# Import Pinboard Bookmarks to Chrome
An extension to import bookmarks from the [Pinboard](https://pinboard.in) bookmark service into the [Chrome browser](https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/).

This is not a 'sync', as bookmarks created manually in Chrome will not be pushed to Pinboard.

This is only guaranteed to work in the latest version of Chrome. I've seen other extensions like the Google Mail Checker that do a certain amount of work to be backwards-compatible. Since I'm always on the latest, that's all I'm testing for.
